# Across Region Communication

Welcome to the Repository for the Brain Hack 2026 project titled Quantifying Neural Communication Across Brain Regions, proposed by Pietro Bozzo, Gianmarco Cafaro, Gabriele Casagrande, and Giacomo Preti!

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to study how interactions between brain regions support memory consolidation. We’ll do so by studying a network of regions well known for its role in the consolidation of spatial memory, namely hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus reuniens (NR). We aim to explore and test different metrics, or a combination of complementary metrics (e.g., synchronicity, dynamic functional connectivity, transfer entropy), to find hallmarks of communication in the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously from multiple areas.

## Contents

The repository is structured in three main sections:

- Code: this is where we'll store scripts and notebook
- Data: this is where you can load data from; quantities which require long computations can also be saved here
- Figures: here we'll save figures showing preliminary results

Subfolders for each of those can be created for different tasks whithin the project.
